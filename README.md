# Pigify

Pigify is a dapp designed to help people save money. 

### How it works

It works by allowing individuals to lock their coins into a smart contract until they reach their desired savings goal. The smart contract automatically holds the funds until the target amount is reached, providing a secure and convenient way for people to save and manage their crypto assets. The token is built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and decentralization. By using "Pigify", individuals can resist the temptation to spend their hard-earned money impulsively, helping them reach their savings goals faster and more efficiently.
